## About

Blab-a-Gag is a fairly simple forum type application  which allows:
* Users can post a one-liner joke.
* Users can follow the jokes of other users or not (listen or ignore).
* Users can comment on other users messages (heckle).

### URLs

* `/feed` shows the jokes/heckles that are relevant to the current user.
* `/blabbers` shows a list of all other users and allows the current user to listen or ignore. 
* `/profile` allows the current user to modify their profile.
* `/login` allows you to log in to your account
* `/register` allows you to create a new user account
* `/tools` shows a tools page that shows a fortune or lets you ping a host.

 
## Run

If you don't already have Docker this is a prerequisite.

```
docker run --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 antfie/verademo
```

Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8080.

## Exploitation Demos

See the `docs` folder.

## Technologies Used

* Spring boot
* MariaDB

## Development

To build the container run this:
```
docker pull mariadb:10.6.2
docker build --no-cache -t verademo .
```

To run the container for local development run this:

```
docker run --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 --entrypoint bash -v "$(pwd)/app:/app" verademo
```

You will then need to manually run the two commands within `/entrypoint.sh`. The first starts the DB in the background whereas the second compiles and runs the application. Typically a container shouldn't have multiple services but this was done for convenience.
